| https://axis.apache.org/axis2/java/core/                       | This can be abused similar to Tomcat. We will often actually see it sitting on top of a Tomcat installation. If we cannot get RCE via Tomcat, it is worth checking for weak/default admin credentials on Axis2. We can then upload a https://github.com/tennc/webshell/tree/master/other/cat.aar in the form of an AAR file (Axis2 service file). There is also a Metasploit https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/96224/Axis2-Upload-Exec-via-REST.html that can assist with this.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

Furthermore, if we can log in to the administrative console with default credentials such as system:manager we can deploy a WAR file (similar to Tomcat) and gain RCE via a web shell or reverse shell.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

This https://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/exploit/multi/http/vmware_vcenter_uploadova_rce/ vulnerability was disclosed in early 2021, and a PoC for https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-22005 was released during the development of this module. vCenter comes as both a Windows and a Linux appliance. If we get a shell on the Windows appliance, privilege escalation is relatively simple using JuicyPotato or similar. We have also seen vCenter already running as SYSTEM and even running as a domain admin! It can be a great foothold in the environment or be a single source of compromise. |
